# Portfolio Change Guide

Use this file as a checklist for personalizing the website.

## Quick content edits

1. **Header identity**
   - Update your name and tagline in `index.html`.
   - Current section: header block near the top.

2. **Hero summary**
   - Replace the short intro sentence with your latest role/interest.
   - Keep this to 1–2 lines for clarity.

3. **Links**
   - Replace placeholder links for GitHub and LinkedIn.
   - Add real project repo/write-up links under each project card.

4. **Images**
   - Replace all `https://placehold.co/...` URLs with your own images.
   - Suggested images:
     - Hero: professional photo or lab/workstation setup
     - About: research/lab context
     - Projects: one visual per project (diagram, benchmark chart, architecture)
     - Contact: conference/speaking image (optional)

5. **Publications**
   - Add complete citation text + DOI/arXiv/publisher links.

## Design improvement ideas (simple + research-friendly)

- Keep a **minimal neutral palette** (already done), then add one subtle accent color only.
- Add a **single typography scale** (e.g., consistent heading/paragraph sizes) and avoid decorative effects.
- Use **more whitespace** around section headings and cards to improve readability.
- Consider adding a **selected publications card layout** with year, venue, and one-line contribution.
- Add a small **"Research Interests" list** near top for quick scanning by recruiters/faculty.

## Content improvement ideas

- For each project, include:
  - **Problem** (1 line)
  - **Approach** (1 line)
  - **Result** (1 line, ideally metric)
- Add a short **"Impact" or "Results"** section with concrete numbers (speedup, memory savings, scale).
- Add **tooling depth** briefly (CUDA, CUTLASS, Nsight, cuTensorNet) tied to outcomes.
- Replace generic publication placeholders with finalized references.
- Add a **downloadable one-page CV** and ensure the filename/path is correct.

## Optional next upgrades

- Add a separate `projects.html` page with detailed case studies.
- Add a lightweight favicon and Open Graph preview image.
- Add Google Scholar + ORCID links if applicable.
